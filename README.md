"git add branch_name" tracks particular branch  
Git commands need messages

git push origin "branch name"  \\to push to specific branch  
git remote add origin "link" \\to link a repository started in terminal to one that exists on git hub
git remote -v \\ see's what repository is linked to git hub
git remote -u origin "branch name" \\ this sets up an upstream which would make it so that every time you push from this repository it puts it in the branch that you mentioned
git checkout -b "branch name"\\ creates new branch
git checkout "branch name" \\to create a new branch
git merge \ merges the branches 
get diff "name of branch you are trying to compare"\\ shows difference between two branches
